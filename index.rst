If you find that RARBG is active and you still cannot access it, don't worry. You can unlock RARBG with a few simple steps. All you have to do is change your DNS provider. By default, most users use a DNS that has been preset by their ISP. However, this can be changed easily and free of charge.

Alternatively, I recommend using Google or Cloudflare DNS. These are provided free of charge by companies and can be used by anyone.


How to change your DNS;

Go to your network settings and click on "Network Connections".

Right-click the connection you are using to access the Internet and choose Properties.

Select Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP / IPv4) and click Properties.

At the bottom of the window, select "Use the following DNS server addresses".

To change the DNS settings, you need to enter two of them. If you want to use Google DNS, enter **8.8.8.8** and **8.8.4.4**. If you prefer Cloudflare, enter **1.1.1.1** and **1.0.0.1**.
